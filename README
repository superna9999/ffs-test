FFS-Test: Userspace USB Gadget for ELC 2014
--------------------------------------------

This is the userspace code which runs on a USB device which is using the USB
gadget framework and configfs.  This software manages the endpoints and
provides the acutal source and sync of data.  It has been modified from the
originals to allow configurable endpoint lengths and add additional
endpoints, as well as building outside the kernel source tree.  This code
was used for my talk titled "USB and the Real World" at Embedded Linux
Conference 2014.

It is copied and modified from the ffs-test program which is part of the
Linux Kernel sources (located in tools/usb).
